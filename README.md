# Credit Score Classification

This project aims to build a machine learning model to classify credit scores based on a person's credit-related information. The model helps in segregating individuals into different credit score brackets, reducing manual efforts and streamlining the process.

## Problem Statement

As a data scientist in a global finance company, the task was to build an intelligent system to segregate individuals into credit score brackets based on their credit-related information. 

## Dataset

The dataset contains basic bank details and credit-related information of individuals. It includes features such as age, income, credit history, loan amount, loan term, etc. The target variable is the credit score, which is categorized into different brackets.

## Approach

1. *Data Preprocessing:* Cleaned the dataset by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.

2. *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):* Explored the dataset to gain insights into the distribution of features, relationships, and correlations.

3. *Feature Engineering:* Created new features and transformed existing ones to improve model performance.

4. *Model Selection:* Experimented with different machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest etc.

5. *Model Evaluation:* Evaluated the models using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

6. *Hyperparameter Tuning:* Tuned hyperparameters of the best-performing model using techniques like Grid Search and Random Search.

7. *Model Deployment:* Deployed the best model for credit score classification.
